TMFS-MTS is a MATLAB toolbox for feature selection in multivariate time series using metaheuristics.

Authors:
Mariusz Oszust, Marian Wysocki

## Installation
Requires:
Signal Processing Toolbox
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
Deep Learning Toolbox
 
## Run on MATLAB 2023b
Usage: 

run runTMFSMTSDemo.m script
This script demonstrates the use of TMFS-MTS for feature selection in  
multivariate time series using metaheuristic optimization techniques.  
It includes dataset loading, parameter configuration, execution of  
metaheuristic algorithms, and visualization of results.  

Steps:
1. Setup optimization options.
2. Select and process the dataset.
3. Execute metaheuristic algorithms for feature selection.
4. Compute performance metrics.
5. Generate plots and visualize results.
